# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset

## Project Description

This project conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset to understand its characteristics and relationships between features. The Iris dataset is widely used in data science and machine learning for benchmarking and educational purposes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the EDA code and visualizations.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to perform EDA on the Iris dataset.

## Key Features

1. **Loading and Initial Inspection of Data**: Load the Iris dataset and perform a preliminary inspection to understand its structure and contents.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Examine the dataset for any missing values and handle them appropriately to ensure data integrity.

3. **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**:
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Perform analysis using histograms, box plots, violin plots, density plots, and swarm plots to understand the distribution of individual features.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Use scatter plots to explore the relationships between pairs of features.

4. **Data Visualization**: Create a variety of plots to visualize relationships and distributions within the dataset:
   - Histogram
   - Boxplot
   - Bar Chart
   - Pie Chart
   - Pair Plots
   - Heatmap

5. **Collinearity**: Calculate the correlation matrix and visualize it using a heatmap to identify and understand the collinearity among features.

## Results
The EDA results provide insights into the characteristics of the Iris dataset, including:

- Distribution of each feature
- Correlation between features
- Visual patterns that may indicate relationships or clusters
